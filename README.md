###<h2> Hi! I'm Ignacio GarcÃ­a ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<h4>I'm  a programmer on beta testing!</h4>

Hi! My name is Ignacio and I've been learning programation since Aug 2020. During this quarantine I had the opportunity to focus on development and i've enjoyed it a lot.

I'm a very curious person :mag_right:, so if I donÂ´t know something I will find out how to do it and I think that's why programming has been a perfect fit for me.

Also, :mortar_board: I am finishing my bachelor's degree on History :mortar_board: and previously was working as a Community Manager at an online clothing bussines.

:trumpet:I just graduated with a diploma on FullStack web development with React.js at UTN.ba and I'm happy to enter the market as a web or software dev!

In my spare time I like watchin movies, cooking, gaming and reading books.
