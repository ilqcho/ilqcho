<h2>I'm Ignacio GarcÃ­a ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<h4>Full-Stack/Front-End developer!</h4>

Hi! My name is Ignacio and I've been learning programation since Aug 2019. During the quarantine I had the opportunity to focus on development and i've enjoyed it a lot.

:trumpet:I graduated with a diploma on FullStack web development with React.js at UTN.ba and I'm happy to say that I a, already working a web developer!

I'm a very curious person :mag_right:, so if I donÂ´t know something I will find out how to do it and I think that's why programming has been a perfect fit for me.

Also, I have a bachelor's degree on History :mortar_board:, yes I am one of those history geeks. 

In my spare time I like playing the guitar, going out with friends, gaming and reading books.
